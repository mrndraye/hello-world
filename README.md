# hello-world

Hello to anyone who cares.

My name is Miranda and I am brand new to coding and programming. My main goal as of now is to become proficient in programming languages. I am interested in cryptography, cyber security, DevOps and UX design - so I pretty much run the gamut. I got my start in all of this because I love problem-solving and figuring out what all I am able to do tech wise. I downloaded an app called Alfred and loved playing with the workflows and making things happen.
